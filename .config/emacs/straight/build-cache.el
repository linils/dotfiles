:commands        Define autoloads for commands defined by the package.
                 This is useful if the package is being lazily loaded,
                 and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to `:commands', but used for non-interactive functions.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `face-spec-set' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
:vc              Install the package directly from a version control system
                 (using `package-vc.el').

buffer manually.

If you run into issues, use `\\[flycheck-verify-setup]' to get help.

Flycheck supports many languages out of the box, and many
additional ones are available on MELPA.  Adding new ones is very
easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and
request features at URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck'.

Flycheck displays its status in the mode line.  In the default
configuration, it looks like this:

`FlyC'     This buffer has not been checked yet.
`FlyC*'    Flycheck is running.  Expect results soon!
`FlyC:0'   Last check resulted in no errors and no warnings.
`FlyC:3|5' This buffer contains three errors and five warnings.
           Use `\\[flycheck-list-errors]' to see the list.
`FlyC-'    Flycheck doesn't have a checker for this buffer.

You may also see the following icons:
`FlyC!'    The checker crashed.
`FlyC.'    The last syntax check was manually interrupted.
`FlyC?'    The checker did something unexpected, like exiting with 1
           but returning no errors.

(fn &optional ARG)" t) (autoload 'flycheck-define-error-level "flycheck" "Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

(fn LEVEL &rest PROPERTIES)") (function-put 'flycheck-define-error-level 'lisp-indent-function 1) (autoload 'flycheck-define-command-checker "flycheck" "Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Some checkers that support reading from standard input have
     a separate flag to indicate the name of the file whose
     contents are being passed on standard input (typically
     `stdin-filename').  In that case, use the `(option)' form in
     `:command' to pass the value of variable `buffer-file-name'
     when the current buffer has a file name (that is,
     use `option \"--stdin-file-name\" buffer-file-name').

     For buffers not backed by files, checkers that support input
     on stdin typically report a file name like `-' or `<stdin>'.
     Make sure your error parser or patterns expect these file
     names (for example, use `(or \"<stdin>\" (file-name))') or
     call `flycheck-remove-error-file-names' in a custom
     `:error-filter'.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.
